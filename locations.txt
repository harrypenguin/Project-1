You are inside University College. It smells like Tom Fairgrieve in here, and you are really relieved to see (smell) your CSC110 professor again. Maybe, if you explain your situation to him, he'll help you out...

You are in the basement level of Gerstein Library. Type look for the full description of this location.
You are in the basement level of Gerstein Library. As the lights flicker ominously, you glimpse a piece of paper wedged between the bookshelves. Was that always there? It wasn't there last night when you came here. Wait, you were here last night? As you try to pull out the paper, your path is blocked by a giant moving bookshelf. However, the rotating handle is locked. There's a pin pad with letters...What's the password?

You get in the elevator, the only path out of the basement. It's a quiet and smooth trip this time. Type look for the full description of this location.
You get in the elevator. It is the only path out of the basement. The buttons in the elevator number 1-8, but you don't have enough time to check all the floors for your pen. To make matters worse, irritating elevator music starts playing through the speakers. As you try to concentrate on making a decision, you realize there's a lot more to this strange song. These are actually instructions. The song playing overhead is actually just one note in different rhythms and tempo, and the whole range of musical notes can be named by single letters A through F, which would correspond to floors 1-8 respectively. Using your perfect pitch, type in the correct number (1-8 inclusive) corresponding to the note playing overhead.

You are at the Parliament. Ben sits at a desk, doing nothing. Type look for the full description of this location.
The Parliament employee at the Parliament help desk looks eager to help. After reading his nametage (Ben) and thinking of a strategy, you realize that you aren't afraid to negotiate with him as long as you have the right resources ($) to do so. Maybe he can help you cancel all testing in Canada so you can find your missing Tcard. Or even better, he can just tell you where your Tcard is. Either way, you know how the wheels of bureaucracy turn...
