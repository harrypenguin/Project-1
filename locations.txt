You are at the Garden between University College and the Front Campus.
The grass is greener here, and there are even vegetables!
This leads you to wonder if you are vitamin C deficient.
You see a figure standing in the UC building. A doctor?

You are inside University College. It smells like Tom Fairgrieve in here.
You are inside University College. It smells like Tom Fairgrieve in here, and you are really relieved to see (smell)
your CSC110 professor again. Maybe, if you explain your situation to him, he'll help you out....

You are inside Myhal. The engineers in here look a bit scary.
You are inside Myhal. All around you are engineers walking to class, and they are judging you,

LOCATION 5 (Con hall)
3
You are inside Convocation Hall. That's ironic, because you need to pass your exam first before you graduate.
You are inside Convocation Hall. There's no one in this building. None of your classmates are here.
Maybe you actually fell asleep for 4 years, and they've all graduated without you. One can dream!

You are inside Gerstein Library. After pleading with the guard, he lets you in despite the
fact that you're missing your Tcard. He can't help but give you a piece of unsolicited
advice: "You should check the basement." Wow, who asked him?

LOCATION 7 (Basement)
3
You are in the basement level of Gerstein Library. You can't help but feel like you've studied here before.
You are in the basement level of Gerstein Library. As the lights flicker ominously, you glimpse a piece of
paper wedged between the bookshelves. Was that always there? It wasn't there last night when you came here. Wait,
you were here last night? As you try to pull out the paper, your path is blocked by #uh what is the game instructions for the caesar cipher?

LOCATION 8 (Elevator)
3
You get in the elevator, the only path out of the basement. It's a quiet and smooth trip this time.
You get in the elevator. It is the only path out of the basement. The buttons in the elevator number 1-8,
but you don't have enough time to check all the floors for your pen. To make matters worse, irritating
elevator music starts playing through the speakers. As you try to concentrate on making a decision, you realize
there's a lot more to this strange song. These are actually instructions. The song playing overhead is actually
just one note in different rhythms and tempo, and the whole range of musical notes can be named by single letters
A through F, which would correspond to floors 1-8 respectively. Using your perfect pitch, type in the correct number
(1-8 inclusive) corresponding to the note playing overhead.

LOCATION 13 (Parliament)
3
You are at the Parliament help desk and you are eager to get the employee to help you!
The Parliament employee at the Parliament help desk looks eager to help. After reading his nametage (Ben) and thinking
of a strategy, you realize that you aren't afraid to negotiate with him as long as you have the right resources ($) to
do so. Maybe he can help you cancel all testing in Canada so you can find your missing Tcard. Or even better, he can
just tell you where your Tcard is. Either way, you know how the wheels of bureaucracy turn...
